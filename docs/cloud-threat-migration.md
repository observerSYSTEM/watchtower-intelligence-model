# Cloud Threat Migration

## Purpose

Modern digital threats rarely disappear.

When disrupted, they migrate.

Cloud infrastructure, platform ecosystems, and automated services have fundamentally changed how hostile systems persist. Infrastructure can be replaced within minutes, identities recreated at scale, and services redeployed across providers with minimal friction.

Watchtower introduces **Cloud Threat Migration** as a core analytical concept to explain this behaviour.

Migration is not an anomaly.

It is the expected operating model.

## The Nature of Cloud-Native Threats

Cloud native environments provide legitimate benefits such as elasticity, availability, and automation.

These same properties also enable hostile systems to:

- redeploy infrastructure rapidly
- rotate domains at low cost
- recreate identities at scale
- adapt to enforcement pressure

As a result, takedown actions often disrupt visibility rather than eliminate capability.

Understanding migration is therefore essential to long term defence.

---

## Migration vs Disappearance

Traditional analysis assumes that removal of an artifact equates to resolution.

Watchtower challenges this assumption.

When a domain is suspended or an account removed, three outcomes are possible:

1. Termination — rare  
2. Dormancy — temporary  
3. Migration — most common  

Migration represents continuity under a different surface.

## Migration Pathways

Threat systems commonly migrate across multiple dimensions.

### Domain Migration
- replacement domains registered shortly after takedown
- reuse of naming conventions
- consistent registrar or DNS patterns

### Infrastructure Migration
- movement between hosting providers
- reuse of ASNs
- redeployment using identical configuration templates

### Platform Migration
- switching between social or content platforms
- recreation of identities using similar profiles
- redirection of audiences to new surfaces

### Identity Migration
- reuse of usernames
- similar biography language
- identical communication channels

These pathways rarely occur independently.

They are often coordinated.

## Migration Triggers

Migration is typically initiated by identifiable triggers, including:

- enforcement actions
- service disruption
- account suspension
- domain revocation
- infrastructure instability

These triggers act as **temporal anchors**, shaping subsequent behaviour.

Observing activity following triggers provides strong insight into system resilience.

---

## Migration Timing

Migration does not occur randomly.

Patterns frequently emerge:

- immediate redeployment (minutes to hours)
- delayed redeployment (days)
- strategic re-entry (weeks)

The timing of migration reveals organisational maturity and operational confidence.

---

## Migration Signatures

Although surface artifacts change, underlying signatures often persist.

Examples include:

- repeated language structures
- identical call to action patterns
- reused contact mechanisms
- consistent redirection behaviour

These signatures allow Watchtower to track continuity across change.

---

## Migration and Threat Constellations

Migration does not dissolve a constellation.

It reshapes it.

Threat Constellations evolve as new artifacts replace old ones, preserving structural continuity over time.

Understanding this evolution prevents false assumptions of resolution.

---

## Defensive Implications

Cloud threat migration challenges traditional security metrics.

Success cannot be measured solely by takedown counts.

Effective defence requires:

- longitudinal observation
- relationship aware analysis
- anticipation of reappearance
- resilience-focused strategy

Watchtower enables this shift by modelling migration as expected behaviour.

---

## Summary

Cloud-native threats persist through movement, not permanence.

By treating migration as continuity rather than novelty, Watchtower enables defenders to understand hostile systems beyond surface-level disruption.

Stopping individual artifacts may interrupt operations.

Understanding migration reveals the system behind them.
